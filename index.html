    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Reymond Christian Hadi, I currently studying at Gunadarma University in Indonesia. I'm majoring Information System, but i actually has a huge interest on engineer and programmer. I know my current major doesn't really suit my interest, but i believe it doesn't matter where you study, you can still learn other things.</p>
